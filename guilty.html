            <h3>Guilty</h3>
            <p>
                Guilt can weigh heavily on the heart, especially when we know we've done wrong or hurt someone. 
                But guilt is not meant to destroy you, it's meant to draw you closer to God's mercy. 
                He doesn't want you to stay stuck in shame. 
                Instead, He offers forgiveness, freedom, and a fresh start through His grace.
            </p>

                    This verse reminds us that God's forgiveness is not something we have to earn, it's a gift. 
                    When you bring your mistakes and regrets to Him with an honest heart, He doesn't condemn you; 
                    He cleanses you. Guilt can become grace when you let God transform it into healing. 
                    Forgiveness sets you free to move forward with peace and purpose.
