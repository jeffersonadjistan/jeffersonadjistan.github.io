        <h3>Sad</h3>
        <p>
            It's okay to feel this way. Sadness reminds us that we care deeply about people, moments, 
            and things that matter to us. It's a sign of a heart that feels and loves. Even when the world 
            feels heavy, remember that God sees every tear and will always care for you.
        </p>

            This verse is a quiet promise — that you are never alone, even in sorrow. 
            God’s presence is closest when your heart feels most fragile. 
            He doesn’t rush your pain away; He sits with you in it, bringing comfort and gentle strength. 
            You can rest in knowing that your tears matter to Him, and in time, 
            He will turn your mourning into peace and hope.
