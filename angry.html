            <h3>Angry</h3>
            <p>
                Anger is a real and natural emotion, and feeling it doesn't make you a bad person. 
                It often comes from hurt, frustration, or a sense of injustice. 
                What matters is what you do with that feeling. 
                God understands your anger, and He invites you to bring it to Him instead of letting it take control.
            </p>

                    This verse reminds us that it's okay to feel anger, but it's important to handle it with wisdom. 
                    God calls us to be patient and thoughtful, not ruled by emotion. 
                    Taking time to breathe, pray, and listen helps us respond with love instead of reacting in frustration. 
                    Let your anger turn into understanding and forgiveness, not bitterness.
