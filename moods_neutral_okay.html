            <h3>Feeling Okay</h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes life feels steady — not too high, not too low — and that's perfectly fine. 
                Being okay doesn't mean you lack emotion, it means you're learning balance. 
                It's the quiet space between joy and sadness where gratitude can grow. 
                Even in ordinary days, there is grace in the simple things, and peace in knowing that God is still at work.
            </p>

                    This verse is a gentle reminder that peace and contentment aren't about everything going right, 
                    but about trusting God in every situation. 
                    Even on average days, when nothing feels special, there is beauty in simplicity. 
                    God is present in your routines, your thoughts, and your quiet moments. 
                    Being okay is a sign that your heart is resting where it belongs — in His care.
