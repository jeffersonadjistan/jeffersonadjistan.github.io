            <h3>Feeling Disappointed</h3>
            <p>
                Disappointment can feel heavy — when something you hoped for doesn't happen, 
                or when someone lets you down. It's okay to feel sad or frustrated. 
                Even in these moments, God understands your pain. 
                He doesn't waste your disappointment — He uses it to grow your faith, 
                strengthen your patience, and lead you to something better.
            </p>

                    This verse reminds us that God is near when we feel let down. 
                    Even when prayers seem unanswered, He is still working behind the scenes 
                    for your good. Disappointment doesn't mean defeat — it means God has 
                    something different, and often better, in store. Trust His timing, 
                    and let your hope rest in His faithfulness.
