            <h3>Feeling Amazed!</h3>
            <p>
                What a wonderful feeling! To be amazed is to stand in awe of something greater than yourself, 
                to pause and realize how beautifully God works in your life and in the world around you. 
                Every sunrise, every heartbeat, every act of kindness is a reminder of His incredible design. 
                When you feel amazed, it's an invitation to worship and to recognize His glory in everything.
            </p>

                    This verse is a celebration of God's artistry and care. 
                    When we stop to notice His creation — from the stars in the sky to the details of our own hearts — 
                    we can't help but feel amazed. His works are beyond measure, and yet, He knows each of us personally. 
                    Let your amazement lead to gratitude and praise, knowing that the same God who made the universe also made you with love and purpose.
