            <h3>Motivated</h3>
            <p>
                That's amazing! Motivation is the fire that keeps you moving toward your goals, 
                It's the energy to grow, to try again, and to keep believing that your efforts matter. 
                True motivation doesn't just come from excitement, it comes from purpose, discipline, 
                and the faith that God is working through every step you take. 
                When your drive comes from Him, your strength never runs out.
            </p>

                    This verse is a powerful reminder that real motivation isn't just self-driven, 
                    it's God-powered. When your confidence is rooted in Him, 
                    you find the courage to face challenges, the patience to keep going, 
                    and the humility to give Him the glory for every victory. 
                    Let your motivation come from gratitude, faith, and a heart willing to serve.
