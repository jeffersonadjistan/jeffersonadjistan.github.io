            <h3>Calm</h3>
            <p>
                Calmness is a gift, a moment to breathe, reflect, and rest in the quiet assurance 
                that God is in control. In a world full of hurry and noise, taking time to be still 
                brings our hearts back to peace and clarity. Calm doesn't mean everything is perfect,
                it means trusting that you're safe in God's hands, even when life feels uncertain.
            </p>

                “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. 
                Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.” — 
                <strong>John 14:27</strong>

                    This verse reminds us that true peace doesn't come from circumstances, but from Christ Himself. 
                    His peace is steady, gentle, and unlike anything the world can offer. 
                    When we quiet our thoughts and turn our hearts toward Him, 
                    we find a calm that endures through every storm. 
                    His peace fills the spaces where worry once lived, reminding us we are held and cared for.
