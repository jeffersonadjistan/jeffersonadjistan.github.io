            <h3>Lazy/Unmotivated</h3>
            <p>
                Some days, it's hard to find energy or purpose. You might feel stuck, tired, or unsure of what to do next. 
                But even when your motivation fades, God's purpose for you does not. 
                He is still working in you, shaping your heart, and leading you forward — even in the quiet seasons.
            </p>

                    This verse reminds you that even when you feel unmotivated, God's work in your life continues. 
                    You don't have to rely on your own strength to keep going — His Spirit gives you the desire and power to act. 
                    Every small step forward, even when it feels insignificant, is part of something bigger. 
                    God hasn't forgotten your purpose, and He won't stop until it's complete.
